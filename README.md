# KMeans-Masculinity

For this project I analyzed data from *FiveThirtyEight* about the way people think about masculinity. It was based on a survey that asks 1189 men different questions in different categories like habits, preferences, daily routines, hobbies, gender, education, sexual orientation, race and age. In that sense, using the KMeans Algorithm I created a classifier that clusters the data of a question and tries to see if they are based on traditional masculine concepts.
